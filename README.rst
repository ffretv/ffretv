Fork and subproject of mythtv that focuses on free tv or over the air tv support; as device support
will be fairly limited to such as DVB HDHOMERUN ATSC and other standards in other countries, maybe iptv as well.

These builds will have limited plugins as well with no web browser such as mythbrower. QtWebkit support has been removed and anything depending on it may not work in these builds. TBD.

I will reimport upstream changes as needed, with a high priority on bugs that affect this build first, with features coming later.
