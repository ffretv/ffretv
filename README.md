Fork and my personal subproject of mythtv that focuses on free tv or over the air tv support; as such, device support will be fairly limited to "Digital terrestrial television"*1).

These builds will have limited plugins as well with no web browser such as mythbrower. QtWebkit support has been removed and anything depending on it may not work in these builds. TBD.

I will reimport upstream changes as needed, with a high priority on bugs that affect this build first, with features coming later. 
According to history*2) mythtv all along has been following the philosophy loyally of the original creator. Making a mythical convergence box into reality. I have nothing against mythtv proper at all in modern times, they do a lot. If upstream didnt exist I could have never created this lessor capable yet more free version. In the past I have had issues with them for ignoring somethings I felt important but its been 5 years since that, and most all those have been addressed since.
I like mythtv upstream I just had the desire to have something less of an attempt at a full "convergence box", I'm going for more of the free limited version of a OTA DVR.  Seems every other company on the planet has a dvr now, so why not. I wanted this before, it just took me some time.


What's currently going on with my branches?

I still have projects that are built around 0.28 so I will continue that until I'm comfortble moving to the next release on those specfic projects. That being said, both 29.X and 31pre have been great for me in my testing. I expect to move to 29.x or just skip forward to 31pre with most all my projects soon. Keep in mind now I'm detached from upstream ast 31pre, and I will likely stay here for a bit between 0.28.X and <31pre.

*Once I get the basic setup here like I want it, I will start bringing in and testing my other projects. I will create them respectivaly as branches here.* 
Git Commentary:
*I can already tell now that I'm serious about learning the full git system, this is going to save me a huge amount of data and time in the future. It's a pretty sweet IDE like system, and yeah I know whom made it orginally. Still its a great setup and I'm glad to FINALLY BE using it better.*
