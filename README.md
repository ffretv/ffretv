Fork and my personal subproject of mythtv that focuses on free tv or over the air tv support; as such, device support will be fairly limited to "Digital terrestrial television"*1).

These builds will have limited plugins as well with no web browser such as mythbrower. QtWebkit support has been removed and anything depending on it may not work in these builds. TBD.

I will reimport upstream changes as needed, with a high priority on bugs that affect this build first, with features coming later. 
According to history*2) mythtv all along has been following the philosophy loyally of the original creator. Making a mythical convergence box in to reality. I have nothing against mythtv proper at all in modern times, they do a lot. If upstream didnt exist I could have never created this lessor capable yet more free version. In the past I have had issues with them for ignoring somethings I felt important but its been 5 years since that, and most all those have been addressed since.
I like mythtv upstream I just had the desire to have something less of an attempt at a full "convergence box", I'm going for more of the free limited version of a OTA DVR.  Seems every other compan on the planet has a dvr now, so why not. I wanted this before, it just took me some time.
