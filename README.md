US GOVERNMENT ADSENCE 3.0 is ATSC 3.0, DONT FOOL YOURSELVES, UNTIL YOU SEE THE SOURCE CODE. OH WAIT, YOU NEVER WILL!

ATSC 3.0 has the potential to affect free over the air tv in drastic ways allegedly all in the name of "BETTER TV".
RIGHT.  NOTE TO THOSE THAT DEVELOPTED THE UPLINK CHANNEL IN ATSC 3.0. We already have this, ITS CALLED THE INTERNET, WHAT EXACTLY DO YOUR THINK YOUR DOING NOW? HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO, ONLY BEZOS and OTHER BIG BIZ GETS THAT AND YOU KNOW IT SO , STOP ALREADY! YOUR THE US GOVERNMENT ALREADY, DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHOM YOU ARE AND SERVICE FIRST? Evidently you need a reminder or NOTE!

At what point did YOU SELF DECIDE TO CHUNK YOUR OWN DOG CHAIN OUT SO FAR NOW? Whom do you represent if not the people as the US GOVERNMENT and the FCC? Shall you represent business first then the people? Because it seems to me with the upstream channel and your CRAP DESIGN that is exactly where your headed.

So getting  the taxes was not enough for the FCC, had to create your OWN BABY OUTSIDE FOR PROFIT DID YA with ATSC 3.0? WOW, must be some nice kick backs coming for someone with ATSC 3.0. Too bad the 99% wont get checks.

I know how it worked, SOME GENIOUS IN OUR GOVERNMENT CONSULTED POLITICIANS AND SAID WE NEED ALL PROFITS LIKE AMAZON,APPLE,GOOGLE, ETC.

WELCOME TO GOVERMENT VENGENCE 3.0,

AKA GOVERNMENT ADs 3.0. 

Note:
*Some theatres may call this epic battle:
```
"US GOVERNMENT ADSENSE 3.0 vs TECH GIANTS, IN BED WITH BUT NOT DONE NOW. TV Appocalypse 3.0"
```


but wait, if your not doing this for the people ATSC 3.0, then whom the HELL ARE YOU DOING THIS FOR?

```
Now that brings me to comment I know all Democrats and Republicans will want to take credit for all future ATSC 3.0 profits, now which one of you PUTz's want to take credit for the REST?
```


Seems to me you just want to bring up TV and turn it into the INTERNET, so you can TAX/ADVERTISE and MONITOR EVERYONE INVASIVLEY EVEN MORE. REAL SMART GENIUS'S , EXCEPT NOTE:
problem ahead, some people are on to YOUR PLANS and are watching your, yes EVEN YOU IN THE FCC designing upstream channels for profit to extract META-DATA, that you will sell back to Amazon and others. WHOM DO YOU THINK YOUR FOOLING BY TELLING THE MASSES THAT THIS IS THE NEXT BEST THING? LIES and PROPAGANDA FOR PROFIT IS ALL IT IS SO FAR, UNLESS YOU FULLY DISCLOSE THE ATSC 3.0 INTENTIONS OPENLY AND IN DETAIL.


LETS TALK ABOUT THAT UPSTEAM CHANNEL YOU SHALL USE, LETS TALK A LOT ABOUT IT.

LETS TALK ABOUT HOW YOU SHALL TRY TO BLOCK ALL CHANNELS IF YOU DONT HAVE A UPLINK AT FIRST, DENY IT pLEASE.

How far shall THE FCC shove its tentacles into our homes and up our wahoos before we say "ENOUGH, THIS NOT OPTIONAL AND OR PUBLIC."?? 

Have an opinion people, dont be so scared. Many people exist with jobs and opinions, it does exist, you can do this, call it balance!

Q.Do we have any say or choices in the matter?

A. "We better have some ideas and not leave it all to UPSTREAM to develop all  kit/kabootle or we shall NOT in return COMPLAIN when they REAM us LATER!"       TradeMark: Sm@rt@$$

ffretv is a fork and my personal subproject of mythtv that focuses on free tv or over the air tv support; as such, tuner type input device support will be fairly limited to "Digital terrestrial television"*1).

ffretv will have limited plugins as well with no web browser such as mythbrower. QtWebkit support has been removed and anything depending on it may not work in these builds. TBD.


```
arch support will be x86_64 and arm/aarch64.*note x86 32bit may still work but I'm totally ignoring it in favor of arm technology.

os support will be posix-like, *development currently on linux with a watchful eye in code parts for bsd compatibility

libc support will be os specific, *currently only tested working with glibc/musl
```

I will reimport upstream changes as needed, with a high priority on bugs that affect this build first, with features coming later. 
According to history*2) mythtv all along has been following the philosophy loyally of the original creator. Making a mythical convergence box into reality. I have nothing against mythtv proper at all in modern times, they do a lot. If upstream didnt exist I could have never created this lessor capable yet more free version. In the past I have had issues with them for ignoring somethings I felt important but its been 5 years since that, and most all those have been addressed since.
I like mythtv upstream I just had the desire to have something less of an attempt at a full "convergence box", I'm going for more of the free limited version of a OTA DVR.  Seems every other company on the planet has a dvr now, so why not. I wanted this before, it just took me some time.


What's currently going on with my branches?

I just recently at the end of 2019 finished up moving all my legacy mythtv/ffretv 0.28-fixes projects over to 29/fixes.
So while upstream perceptibly can move at light speed with huge dev numbers and incremental increases, I alone am pokey joe!

In the short time I've been on my ffretv 29/fixes, I'm quite happy with it. It feels lean, but it is still a far from a prefect setup and still has flaws  that I'm still whittling away.

Unless I find a major flaw in the 29/fixes series with ffretv I expect to turn this into a LTS type release cycle for 29/fixes. Eg. I may decide to use 29/fixes base code set, for a 3-5 year period before moving to the next major upstream release.

I will backport upstream code from master as needed for the 29/fixes branch. Mostly trivial code changes can be backported no problem, but dont expect whole new feature sets from 30/31+ master to make its way back to the ffretv-29/fixes flavor unless its really special.

When its time for ffretv to move to the next mythtv release base codeset, no matter if it is upstream 30/31/32, I will use the easist and/or most productive method possible for me to re-impliment my most important changesets. Eg. I may refork 30-32 and/or reapply ffretv changes afterwards. Or I may just increment merge up the dev chain minimally and manually, not sure yet. 


Original Fork Point from upstream I used for ffretv 29/fixes aka intended ffretv-29/fixes-LTS
```
MythTV Version : v29.1
Network Protocol : 91
Library API : 29.20180316-1
```


for Master its 31-pre with Lib API:
```
31.20190109-1
```

*All my 0.28 projects are now DEPRECATED! While you may use them, I will rarely update them as 29.1 has a better feature set now with ffretv. A new setup introduced in 2016 allowed me to apply my "No WebKit" updated perfect. The new setup included a new method to pull progdetails instead of depending on mythbrowser. That solved a problem in the future a LOT.  Thanks to upstream makes 29.X enough reason to move
to 29.1+. So far I dont see a downside.
